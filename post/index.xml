&lt;h1 id=&#34;hunky-dorys-firey-chilli&#34;&gt;Hunky Dorys - Firey Chilli&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a mundane trip to spar on an uneventful Tuesday evening, a new Hunky Dory
flavour was discovered that neither of us had tried. The initial excitement was
short lived as ** tasted the first crisp. A bland taste followed by a bust of
&amp;ldquo;Fiery&amp;rdquo; Flames. The crisps taste rather oily at the start and there is no
specific flavour, such as paprika, sour cream or salt to them.
You are then hit by the spiciness which makes it impossible to really enjoy
the crisps as your taste buds will quickly become numb. Usually Hunky Dorys
convince with their rich flavours, thus it was a disappointment to realise
that Hunky Dorys didn&amp;rsquo;t display their usual pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully they will shine brighter with their next try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: 2 of 5 Stars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!! This is the first of many posts that will attempt to review crisps from
around the world. The benchmark is Hunky Dorys Salt and Vinegar!! Our personal
favorite crisp type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;crisps-or-chips&#34;&gt;Crisps or chips??&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s crisps! No discussion. Chips are what you get at McDonalds. Right so that
was established I now need to go and format the website so wish me luck and chat
soon.&lt;/p&gt;
